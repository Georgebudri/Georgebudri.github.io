<p>Attempting to make another website through coding and we shall see how it works out. This is my first time ever coding! Hi guys, my name is George Athanasios Budri and this is my company called Budri. For you guys that may not know the story of my logo, the image represents the Molossus dog from the region where my family is from called Epirus. These dogs were used to fight tigers, lions, elephants, and men in battle and helped in a great victory against the Romans in the later years of around 200 BC . These hounds portray great strength and fear to their enemies while maintaining a high class image.</p>
