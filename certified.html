<h1>Certified Coach</h1>

<p>I have been playing tennis since I was 8 years old and eventually got my certification to be a coach at the age of 16. Favorite player would have to be Federer and the racket I use is the Wilson Counter Vail 16x19 98 Blade. There is no tennis team at the University of Maine but I attend the club team once in a while to maintain my skills as they slowly wither away as the days go by. </p>
