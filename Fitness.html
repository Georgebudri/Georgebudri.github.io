<h1>FITNESS</h1>
<H2>Exercise Science Major</H2>

<p>Starting Freshman year of college I grew an interest in fitness which led me to the direction of wanting to be a personal trainer. Eventually I started going to the gym everyday gaining more knowledge in the fitness field and posting videos on my fitness instagram account to also help others and attain some clients as well.</p>

<p> Eventually in the Long run I'm looking to go into the direction of one day owning my own gym or go into ergonomics which deals with the degrees and angles of how we function and how to improve posture.</p>
